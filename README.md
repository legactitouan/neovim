# Neovim Personal Configuration

This is my personal Neovim configuration, designed to improve my productivity and streamline my development workflow. It includes a collection of plugins, settings, and custom mappings to enhance the Neovim experience for programming, editing, and more.

## Features

- **Plugin Management**: Uses [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) (or any other manager you're using) for seamless plugin management.
- **UI Enhancements**: Custom themes, status bars, and other visual improvements to make editing more pleasant.
- **LSP Support**: Fully configured Language Server Protocol (LSP) setup for autocompletion, diagnostics, and more.
- **Key Mappings**: Personal keybindings for common actions.
- **File Navigation**: Fast file navigation with fuzzy finding tools like [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim).
- **Git Integration**: Git tools for viewing diffs, staging, and commits inside Neovim.
- **Other Features**: Syntax highlighting, auto-formatting, and other productivity enhancements.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Neovim 0.5+](https://neovim.io/)
- [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) (or any other plugin manager you're using)

### Steps

1. Clone this repository into your `~/.config/nvim` directory:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2. Install plugins using your plugin manager (e.g., Packer):
    - Open Neovim and run the following command to install plugins:
      ```vim
      :PackerSync
      ```

3. Once the plugins are installed, your Neovim setup should be ready to use!

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of this configuration by editing the respective files. Here are some common places to look:

- `init.lua`: Main configuration file where most of the settings and plugin setups are located.
- `lua/plugins.lua`: Plugin configurations and settings.
- `lua/keymaps.lua`: Custom keybindings.
- `lua/settings.lua`: General Neovim settings (e.g., line numbers, tab behavior).

## Plugins

This configuration uses a variety of plugins to improve functionality, including but not limited to:

- **LSP**: [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)
- **Autocompletion**: [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp)
- **Fuzzy Finder**: [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- **Git**: [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
- **File Explorer**: [nvim-tree.lua](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua)

## Troubleshooting

- **Neovim not starting**: Ensure that you have Neovim 0.5 or higher installed.
- **Plugins not loading**: Run `:PackerSync` to reinstall and update plugins.
- **Errors with LSP**: Make sure that the necessary language servers are installed. You can use [nvim-lspinstall](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer) or manually install them using your preferred package manager.
